# Working Principle
The implementation is based on Courtiers finite element scheme. The original Matlab implementation [IonMonger](https://github.com/PerovskiteSCModelling/IonMonger) and internally uses the same numerical finite element scheme.

# Physical Concepts
## Fundamental Conservation Laws and
## Algebraic Partial Differential Equations
## Recombination mechanisms
## Density of states and doping
## Intrinsic carrier density and temperature

# Couriers Finite Element Scheme
The interested reader should consult Courtiers original publications

here we will provide only a few important fundamentals necessary to understand a few important limitations from fundamental physical perspective as well as in some numerical aspects.
