*A rewrite of Couriters [IonMonger](https://github.com/PerovskiteSCModelling/IonMonger)* 

The implementation is based on Courtiers finite element scheme. The original Matlab implementation [IonMonger](https://github.com/PerovskiteSCModelling/IonMonger) is also freely available on GitHub, however Matlab as proprietary software basis restricts the tool to institutions and people owning a suitable license. This implementation is solely written in julia and therefore free to use for every body owning a x86 computer.
